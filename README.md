# TODOapp
Welcome to my todo app!

This CLI app was mainly created to help me learn Rust language.

## Requirements
To run the code you need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and related tools installed.


## Getting started
Build binary

```bash
cargo build 
```

The binary should now be accesible in target/debug/ named todo.
